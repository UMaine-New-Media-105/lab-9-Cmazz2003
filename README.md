Exercises 1-3: We were instructed to create or reuse a sprite of our choosing and make it so that the sprite would bounce off the x and y of the canvas. We were also instructed to make it so that 50 of them would appear and bounce around at different speeds and positions randomly. The collision detection is a little off for the y coordinate, but otherwise everything we were instructed to do is there. https://editor.p5js.org/CMazz/sketches/ra3f0TvPb
